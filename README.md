# T 4.2 Promises and Async/Await

Create a simple web interface in which you implement calls to an API of your choice and consume its data to display it on the screen. The data returned must be both images and text for each case.

## How it works

The user inputs the name of a game. At submit, a random number between 0 and 10 gets generated. If the number is lower than 5, async/await gets used. If its higher or equals to 5 we uses promises.
